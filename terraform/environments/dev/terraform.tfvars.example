# Example Terraform Variables for Dev Environment
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize as needed

# Note: Most configuration is set in main.tf locals block
# This file is for any additional variables you want to override

# Uncomment and modify these if you want to override defaults:

# instance_type    = "t3.xlarge"
# root_volume_size = 100

# Security - restrict these in production:
# sip_allowed_cidrs = ["203.0.113.0/24"]  # Your office/VPN IP range
# rtp_allowed_cidrs = ["203.0.113.0/24"]  # Your office/VPN IP range
